3. Features Used and Selection Process
Final Features:
	1	Living Area
	2	Terrace Area
	3	Number of Facades
	4	Swimming Pool
	5	Fully Equipped Kitchen (Encoded)
	6	Furnished (Encoded)
	7	Subtype of Property (Encoded)
	8	State of the Building (Encoded)
	9	Compound Listing (Encoded)
	10	Locality
	11	Fireplace(Encoded)
	12	Price (Target)

Feature Engineering Process:
	•	Data Source:
	◦	Derived from the scraped Immoweb dataset.
	•	Feature Elimination:
	◦	Non-informative columns (e.g., id, Type of Sale) were removed to prevent data leakage.
	•	Categorical Encoding:
	◦	Rare categories in Subtype of Property were grouped under "other property."
	◦	Categorical variables were one-hot encoded.
	•	Outlier Handling:
	◦	Handled outliers in Price and Living Area using the IQR method.
	•	Missing Value Imputation:
	◦	Categorical: Most frequent category.
	◦	Numerical: Median value.

4. Accuracy Computing Procedure
Data Splitting:
	•	Train-Test Split: 80% Training / 20% Testing
Cross-Validation:
	•	Method: 5-Fold Cross-Validation
	•	Purpose: To assess model performance and fine-tune hyperparameters.
	•	Validation Metrics: RMSE on each fold, with an average RMSE used for optimization.
	•	Cross-Validation Accuracy: 77.43% (1.42%)

5. Efficiency
Training Time:
	•	Hyperparameter tuning time: 33.56 seconds
	•	Cross-validation time: 5.32 seconds
	•	Model training time: 0.53 seconds
	•	Model evaluation time: 0.02 seconds

6. Dataset Overview
Source:
	•	Scraped data from  immoweb, Belgium's primary real estate listing platform.
Final Dataset Size:
	•	after preprocessing.
Preprocessing Steps:
	•	Number of duplicate rows: 1551
	•	Outliers removed from Price: 1096 rows dropped.
	•	Outliers removed from Living Area: 859 rows dropped.
	•	Outliers handled for columns: ['Price', 'Living Area']
	•	Missing Values:
	•	Dropping columns: ['id', 'Type of property', 'Type of sale', 'Garden', 'Garden area', 'Surface of the land', 'Surface area of the plot of land', 'Terrace', 'Number of rooms']
	◦	Categorical: Imputed using the most frequent category.
	◦	Numerical: Imputed using the median value.
	•	Encoding:
	◦	One-hot encoding applied to categorical variables.
	•	Scaling:
	◦	Log transformations applied to numerical variables for normality.

Remarks:
The dataset is clean, high-quality, and free of data leakage, ensuring reliable model performance.
